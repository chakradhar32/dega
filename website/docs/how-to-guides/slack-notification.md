# Event Notification on Slack

Notify your team on Slack whenever any defined [event](/docs/core-concepts/events) occurs. For example, notify when a new post is published.

### Webhook creation in Slack

First of all, you’ll need to set up a webhook in your team’s Slack configuration. A webhook is a method for Slack to get incoming messages to be posted to your Slack team from external services.

### Webhook customisation & copy URL

Once the webhook is created, you can optionally customise the channel, name, and icon which the webhook uses whenever it posts a message. Copy the Webhook URL at the very top.

### Adding webhook to Dega

In Dega, a webhook can be added from Webhooks Menu by clicking on New Webhook. Here, you can give a name to your webhook and paste the copied webhook URL. From the list of events supported by Dega, you can select events for which you wish to receive a notification. After selection of the events, enable the webhook and then click on the Submit button to add the Webhook.
