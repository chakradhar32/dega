# Search Engine Optimisation

The term "search engine optimization" refers to the process of optimising a website for search engines. In simple terms, it refers to the process of upgrading to boost visibility when people use search engines to look for items or services linked to your business. The higher your pages' exposure in search results, the more likely you are to attract more attention and customers to your business.

The job of a search engine is to crawl a website and determine whether it is relevant to a given search query. While keyword matching within content and backlinks to the page are important factors in ranking, metadata provides further information about the website's purpose. Based on these components, search engines can crawl a website and infer its basic purpose.

### SEO MetaData

Metadata is data that describes other data. However, in SEO, the types of metadata we are discussing provide an overview and summary of the content of a web page.

SEO Metadata comprises of Title, Description, and Canonical URL.

**Meta Title:** The main title of the webpage is specified in the meta title. It's critical to place your keyword as close to the start of the title as feasible.
**Meta Description:** In the metadata, the meta description is displayed underneath the title. It summarises the webpage's content.
**Canonical URL:** A canonical URL informs search engines that a specific URL represents the master copy of a page. Using the canonical URL prevents difficulties caused by identical or "duplicate" content appearing on various URLs. Practically speaking, the canonical URL tells search engines which version of a URL you wish to see in search results.

### Why SEO MetaData

Whilst metadata is critical for SEO, it isn't a direct rating aspect utilized in search engine algorithms. However, there are roundabout advantages that can prompt a lift in rankings.

As mentioned previously, the cause of metadata is to summarise your content, to lure them to click on your web website online. When you show a compelling and informative meta title and description, viewers are much more likely to click on your page.

Google makes use of click-through rate as a method of working out whether or not your web website is a decent outcome. The more individuals navigate to your site, the more Google will take into account you to be a quality outcome. Thus, in this manner, Google would then move you up the positions. An improved natural click-through rate, in the long run, improves rating.
