# Proxy Server for rich media

Dega has built-in support for an oembed proxy server for rich media using [Iframely](https://iframely.com/). Iframely resolves URLs and gives you consistent semantics, rich media, all its shades, thumbnails, and more. This is used to embed related content in your post. You can paste the URL and the content gets embedded in your post.

Iframely includes specific domain parsers for most popular publishers. YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, SoundCloud, Google Maps, TED, Twitch, and many more. In addition, Iframely covers many domains by whitelisting media through the generic publishing protocols: oEmbed, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and microformats.
