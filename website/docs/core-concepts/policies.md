# Policies

Policies are mandatory for Dega to work as expected. Default Policies can be added by clicking on Create Default Policies.

The default policies are 
- Editor
- Contributor
- Author.

Apart from these, the user can add a new policy from the Policy menu by clicking on New Policy. The name for the policy should be provided and can add a description of the policy.

A user is associated with a policy that authorizes what a user can access and update. 
Each policy defines permission to get, create, update and delete a particular entity. Permission to publish or update a post is defined in a policy. These policies are used as permission across the Dega space while making any change to any entity.
