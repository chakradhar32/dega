# Policies

Policies are mandatory for Dega to work as expected. Default Policies can be added by clicking on Create Default Policies.

The default policies are 
- Editor
- Contributor
- Author

A user is associated with a policy that authorizes what a user can access and update. 
Each policy defines permission to get, create, update and delete for entities. Permission to publish or update a post is defined in a policy. These policies are used as permission across the Dega space while making any change to any entity.

All the Policies will be available under the Policies menu. 
Policies can be deleted by clicking on the Delete button. To edit a Policy click on the name of the policy in the list.

The user can add a new policy from the Policy menu by clicking on the New Policy button on the right side.

Users: This allows the user to select users of the application to be associated with the policy. 
Description: Describes what the policy is for.

Permission to be provided to the user for each entity can be marked as checked from the options provided.
