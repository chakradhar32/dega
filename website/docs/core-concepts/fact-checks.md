# Fact Checks

Fact-checks are posts that provide information about a claim made by a claimant with descriptions and facts about the claim.
Fact-Check posts can include claims and images.
Content is written using a text editor, from which images or any related content or link can be embedded.

The user can add information about the fact-check by clicking on the Settings button.
Claims can be added for which fact-check is written. The user can either create a new claim or can add it from the existing claims. More than one claim can be added for a fact-check.
The user can add tags, categories, authors for a fact-check. 
The user can directly publish or can save it as a draft or can save it as ready to publish.

Each post created has status from any of the following.
- Draft
- Published
- Ready to Publish
Once the post is created, templates can be created from the post which can be used for future posts.

Apart from the basic information extra data can be added such as SEO meta data which includes title, description and canonical URL.
There is also provision to add more information about the fact-check if the field is not included in the form. The user can use the Meta fields section to feed in extra data.
