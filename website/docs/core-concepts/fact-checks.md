# Fact Checks

Fact-checks are posts that provide information about a verified claim made by a claimant with descriptions and facts about the claim using textual content and images.
Fact-Check posts can include claims and images.
New fact-check can be created from the Fact-Checks menu by clicking on the New Fact-Check button on the right side.

The user can start writing fact-check using an editor which is a rich text editor. It makes embedding images, links, or any related content very easy.

The user can directly publish or can save it as a draft. The user can also mark the post as ready to Publish.
 
Each post created has status from any of the following.
- Draft
- Published
- Ready to Publish

To save as draft click on the Save button on the right and to save as Ready to Publish; before clicking on the Save button make sure Ready to Publish is checked.
To publish the Fact-Check click on the Publish button. Only the user who is either admin or an editor can publish the fact-check.

Once the post is created, templates can be created from the post which can be used for future posts. Templates are created by clicking on the Create Template button.
New Fact-check posts can be created from templates by clicking on any of the templates available from the Templates section which is at the top of the Fact-check page.

The user can add information about the fact-check by clicking on the Settings button.
