# Tags

Tags are like hashtags. Tags provide a useful way to group related posts. Tags also make it easier for people to find your content.

Users can add or assign tags while creating a post. While adding a tag for a post, if a Tag does not exist then click on Create a Tag <Tag Name> button. This allows users to quickly create a new tag and assign it to a post.

Tags can be added from the Tags menu item by clicking on the New Tag button on the right side.

Description: Describe what tag is for

Featured - Check if the Tag is featured


Apart from the basic information, extra data can be added such as SEO metadata. SEO metadata includes title, description, and canonical URL. It can be added by clicking on the Add MetaData button.

There is also a provision to add more information about the tag if the field is not included in the form. The user can use the Meta fields section by clicking on the Meta Fields section to feed in extra data as a JSON object.
Customizing the header and footer specific to a tag can be done by adding code in the Code Injection section by clicking on the Code Injection section.
