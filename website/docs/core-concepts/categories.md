# Categories

Categories help to group related posts. 
Users can add or assign categories while creating a post. While adding a category for a post, if a category does not exist then click on Create a Category <Category Name>. This allows users to quickly create a new category and assign it to a post.

Name: Name of a category
Parent Category: Select Parent category for the category
Featured - Check if the Tag is featured
Featured Image: Image of category
Description: Describes what the category is for.

Apart from the basic information, extra data can be added such as SEO metadata. SEO metadata includes title, description, and canonical URL. It can be added by clicking on the Add MetaData button.

There is also a provision to add more information about the category if the field is not included in the form. The user can use the Meta fields section by clicking on the Meta Fields section to feed in extra data as a JSON object.
Customizing the header and footer specific to a category can be done by adding code in the Code Injection section by clicking on the Code Injection section.

All the Categories will be available under the Categories menu. 
Search and sort options are available to simplify the search for a Category. Categories can be deleted by clicking on the Delete button. To edit a Category click on the name of the category in the list.
