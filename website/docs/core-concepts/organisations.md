# Organisations

To access Dega, creating an organization is mandatory. If Super Organisation is created while installing Dega, then the user can access Dega or else needs to create an organization from Kavach for having an access to Dega.
There is only one Super Organisation for a Dega instance but can create multiple Organisations as per user requirements. Applications can be added to an organization. 

Each user who is a part of an organization needs to be added to the application to access that application. 
Each organization needs to have at least one space for an application. 
The number of spaces for a Dega application for a particular organization can be managed from the Organisation Requests menu item by creating a request to change the number of spaces.
Basic organization settings can be changed from Kavach.
