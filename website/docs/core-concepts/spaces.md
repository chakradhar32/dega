# Spaces

An organization can create one or more spaces based on permissions and requirements. At least one space is required for Dega. The organization has a limit for the number of spaces for each organization which can be changed by requesting the Organisation Requests menu.

Each space has certain permission which is managed by the admin. These permissions include a defined number of posts, media, and episodes and also enable or disable fact-checks and podcasts. To change permissions for space, a request can be made from the Space Requests menu.
Each space is associated with one organization. 

Spaces can be created from the Space menu item by clicking on New Space.
The form provides the ability to add basic information such as the title, website, description for a space.
Social Media contact information can be added in the Contacts section.
Logos can be added in the Media section.
To get the analytics for a space add information about the server URL, domain, and embed code in the Analytics section.

There is also a provision to add more information about the space if the field is not included in the form, the user can use the Meta fields section to feed in extra data.
Customizing the header and footer for a space can be done by adding code in the Code Injection section.
